title: Deploying a Shelf Server (Dart Backend)
description: This guide will walk you through deploying a simple Dart backend using Shelf on Globe.
---

## 1. Create a new Dart project:

```bash
dart create -t server-shelf my_globe_backend
cd my_globe_backend
```

This creates a new Dart project using the server-shelf template, which provides a basic Shelf server setup.

## 2. Edit bin/server.dart:

Replace the contents of `bin/server.dart` with the following:

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;

void main() async {
  var handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler(_echoRequest);

  var server = await io.serve(
    handler,
    InternetAddress.anyIPv4,
    int.tryParse(Platform.environment['PORT'] ?? '8080') ?? 8080,
  );

  print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
}

Response _echoRequest(Request request) =>
    Response.ok('Hello from Globe.dev! Request for "${request.url}"');

```

This code creates a simple Shelf server that responds to any request with "Hello from Globe.dev!". It also uses the PORT environment variable, which is crucial for running on Globe.dev.

## 3. Deploy to Globe.dev:

```bash
globe deploy
```

The first time you deploy, Globe.dev will prompt you to:

- **Select a project**: Choose between creating a new project or linking to an existing one. Select "**Create a new project**".
- **Choose an entry point**: Globe.dev will detect possible entry points. Accept the default option.
- **Name your project**: Enter a name for your project or accept the suggested name.

Once done, Globe will build and deploy your app, providing you with a unique URL.

## 4. Visit the URL:

Open the provided URL in your browser. You should see the "Hello from Globe.dev!" message.
