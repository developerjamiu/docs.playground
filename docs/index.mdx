title: Setting Up Your Development Environment
---

Before you can start building with Globe.dev, you'll need to set up your development environment. This involves installing the Dart SDK and the Globe CLI.

## 1. Install the Dart SDK:

If you don't already have the Dart SDK installed, follow the [official instructions](https://dart.dev/get-dart) for your operating system.

## 2. Install the Globe CLI:

The Globe CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows you to interact with Globe.dev from your terminal. To install it, open your terminal and run:

```bash
dart pub global activate globe_cli
```

This command downloads and installs the CLI, making the globe command available globally on your system.

## 3. Verify Installation:

To ensure everything is installed correctly, run:

```bash
globe --version
```

This should print the version number of the Globe CLI, confirming a successful installation.
