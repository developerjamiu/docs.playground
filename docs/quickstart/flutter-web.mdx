description: This guide will walk you through deploying a basic Flutter web application to Globe.dev.

## 1. Create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create my_globe_flutter_app
cd my_globe_flutter_app
```

## 2. Build for the web:

```bash
flutter build web
```

This creates a build/web directory containing the compiled web application.

## 3. Deploy to Globe.dev:

```bash
globe deploy
```

The CLI will automatically detect that this is a Flutter Web project and use the appropriate settings. You'll be prompted to confirm and provide a project name.

## 4. Visit the URL:

Open the provided URL in your browser. You should see the default Flutter counter application.
